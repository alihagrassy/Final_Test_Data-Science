# 1-PEP8
PEP8 is a style guide for Python code. It defines a set of rules for how Python code should be formatted.
PEP8 is a widely accepted standard, and it is important to follow it if you want your Python code to be readable and maintainable.

# 2-Poetry
Poetry is a tool for managing Python packages. It makes it easy to install, update, and manage Python packages. 
Poetry also provides a way to create isolated environments for your Python projects. 
This can be helpful for preventing dependency conflicts and ensuring that your projects are reproducible.

# 3-Docker
Docker is a containerization platform. It allows you to package your applications and their dependencies into isolated containers.
 This makes it easy to deploy and run your applications in any environment.
 Docker is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the portability and scalability of your applications.

# 4-Generative AI
Generative AI is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content. 
This can include generating text, images, or even music. 
Generative AI is a rapidly growing field, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we create and consume content.

# 5-Large Language Model
A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence that is trained on a massive dataset of text. 
This allows LLMs to generate text that is similar to human-written text.
LLMs are used in a variety of applications, including machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.

# 6-Attention all you need
Attention all you need is a paper that describes a new approach to training LLMs. 
This approach uses attention to focus on the most important parts of the input text. 
This allows LLMs to generate more accurate and informative text.
